Titanic Kaggle Survival Prediction
This repository contains the code and resources for predicting survival on the Titanic. This project is based on the Kaggle competition "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".

Overview
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, resulting in the deaths of a large portion of its passengers and crew. This project aims to predict which passengers survived the tragedy based on features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project (train.csv and test.csv) is available on Kaggle and contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger's name
Sex: Passenger's sex
Age: Passenger's age in years
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, converting categorical features, and feature engineering.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the data to understand relationships and distributions.

Model Building: Training and evaluating different machine learning models to predict survival.

Model Evaluation: Comparing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC curves.

Files
Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the complete analysis, from data cleaning to model evaluation.
train.csv and test.csv: Dataset files used for training and testing models.
Dependencies
Python 3
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Usage
To run the notebook, ensure you have Python 3 installed along with the required libraries. Open the Jupyter notebook Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb and execute each cell sequentially.

Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test set, demonstrating effective prediction capabilities.

Conclusion
This project provides insights into predicting survival on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. It serves as a foundational example for understanding data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation in a real-world dataset.
