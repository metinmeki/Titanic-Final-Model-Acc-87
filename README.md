Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains the complete code and resources for building a machine learning model to predict passenger survival aboard the Titanic. It is based on the Kaggle competition: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster.

Overview
The RMS Titanic sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg during her maiden voyage. This tragic event resulted in the deaths of over 1,500 passengers and crew members. In this project, we aim to predict which passengers survived based on various features such as age, sex, passenger class, and more.

 Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes:

train.csv – Training data containing passenger features and survival outcome.

test.csv – Test data for model evaluation.

Key Features:
PassengerId: Unique identifier

Survived: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes)

Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)

Name: Passenger's name

Sex: Passenger's gender

Age: Age in years

SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Parch: Number of parents/children aboard

Ticket: Ticket number

Fare: Passenger fare

Cabin: Cabin number

Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
